# Contestant

### Programming contests made easy!
Apache and MySQL are built in for easy deployment.

Uniform Server is included with Contestant and allows for a one button start and stop.

Currently the portable version is only for Windows. Mac and Linux portable versions will be coming soon. Until then, you must set up your own server to run php and phalcon.

### Works on ChromeOS and Android*
Utilizes Ace Editor in the browser so even if you cant locally compile, you can still compete!

You can edit the files on Ace and save them to the host computer where you can test and submit them.

*The host must be able to compile Java

### Written in PHP, backed up by C
Contestant uses PhalconPHP, a php framework written as a C-extension, optimized for speed!

Because it is written in PHP, there is no need for any special tools. Just make sure to have the Java JDK and a browser of your choice and you're ready to go!

### Easy on the Admins
The backend Admin Panel makes editing the configuration or adding teams a breeze.

Because everything is on the web, you open it up in a browser and login like any other website. Could it be any easier?

### Languages
Currently, only Java is available.
